### How to run local
### How to connect to db locally

2. In the pop-up window:
    - enter **"localhost"** as the server name;
    - select **"windows authentication"** as authentication mechanism;
3. After the connection has been established, right-click on the server (the first line with the icon), on the left-hand side of the UI
4. In the the appeared window find and click on **"properties"**
5. In the properties section, select **"security"** page
6. Make sure that **"Server authentication"** radio-button is set to **"SQL Server and Windows Authentication mode"**
7. Click "Ok"
8. Then again, on the left-hand side of the UI find folder entitled **"Security"**, and expand it
9. In unrolled list of options find folder "Logins", and expand it
10. At this point, you should have **"sa"** as the last option.

11. Right-click on the "sa" item, select "properties"
12. Change password to the default system one - **"Admin@1234"**. Don't forget to confirm it afterwards
13. On the left-hand side select **"Status"** page, and set **"Login"** radio-button to **"Enabled"**
14. Click "Ok"

## Static Code Analysis

To keep the codebase clean and maintainable, we use:

- `.editorconfig` for unified code formatting
- StyleCop analyzers across all projects
- SonarCloud for static code analysis
- SonarLint for IDE integration

Supported editors: Visual Studio 2022 / VS Code / Rider

### Quick Setup

1. **.editorconfig**  
Already included ‚Äî most IDEs pick it up automatically.

2. **SonarLint**  
Set up SonarLint and bind it to the `VictoryCenter-Back` project of the `ita-social-projects` org using your personal SonarCloud token.

3. **Fix issues locally**  
Your IDE will highlight style/code issues in real time. Please, fix them before committing anything to avoid CI fails.

**Detailed setup guide:** [docs/104-Static-Code-Analysis.md](docs/104-Static-Code-Analysis.md)
